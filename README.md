# Flood Prediction Report of Lagos State.

## Introduction
This report aims to predict the likely period of the next flood in lagos state. This is based on the historical weather data from 2010-2024.
### Dataset Details
This includes weather attributes such as:
- Date : 2010-2024
- Precipitation
- Precipitation cover
- Precipitation type
- Sea level pressure
- Total precipitation

  
### PRECIPITATION
This refers to any form of water, liquid or solid, that falls from the atmosphere and reaches the ground. 
It is a crucial component of the Earthâ€™s water cycle and includes various types of atmospheric water phenomena. The main forms of precipitation are:
- Rain: Liquid water droplets that fall when atmospheric water vapor condenses to form droplets that become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and gravity.
- Snow: Frozen precipitation that occurs when temperatures are low enough for water vapor to form ice crystals, which then clump together  to fall as snowflakes.

Precipitation is measured using a variety of instruments, including rain gauges for liquid precipitation and snow gauges or snow boards for solid forms.
Precipitation is an important factor in weather patterns, climate and hydrology,  affecting water supply, agriculture and ecosystem.

### Calculating Total Precipitation
#### By Year
From the diagram below, 2011 had a total precipitation of 3,898.00 when measured by year making it the year with the highest Precipitation. 
Note, high precipitation level is relative to increased rainfall, which has a high tendency of causing floods.


#### By Month & day
When total precipitation is measured by month, from 2010-2024, June had the highest total precipitation of 4,080.30 and January had the lowest total precipitation.
